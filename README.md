# OUmonitors

This project's aim is to build an online face-to-face video tutoring platform. 
The project was initiated due to an observation that with the advance of technology, online tutoring was innovated and become more popular in the world. 
As the new type of tutoring style has come up, students could have better management of scheduling and travelling time. 
Our project has developed an online website, which provides a platform for students to study and communicate with others, which helps students to have a better learning process and experience through the Hall of i-Learner. 
This website would act as a virtual classroom. Students are allowed to register for the courses based on tutors' recommendations, where the detail of the course are designed by tutors. After the course, light-weighted assignments would be assigned to students. Other functions like forum and e-mail would be provided for students to have a better understanding of knowledge and experience a better learning environment.

In addition to supporting students, the Hall of i-Learner provides functions for tutors to create assignments easily. 
Tutors are allowed to upload their own materials or make them on the website, which can simplify their workload.
